    <p>In math, every answer is made by a question. In practical reality, every result is made by clear causes in problems. One problem that we have as human beings is that we cannot see the causes that we keep inside ourselves. That&#39;s why it&#39;s not easy to recognize what makes the results we get in life. For this reason, a good teacher can be compared to a mirror â€“ they simply show us ourselves, just as we are. Without such a mirror, how could we see ourselves?
That&#39;s why, in order to change the kind of results you can get in life, you first of all need to change your problems. Good problems have good results; bad problems have bad results. To change your life into one where you continuously get good results, you need to find out how to formulate problems, and then you need to start making good problems for yourself.
It&#39;s not easy, but even though you were born with your existent consciousness, it is certainly possible to change your consciousness so that you can guide your life to a better &quot;destiny&quot;. However, in order to do so, you need to obtain an enlightenment (realization), and then you need to study what exists in the reality that you can see through your enlightenment. Be careful of falsehood. No religions have any helpful teachings when it comes to enlightening yourself.</p>
